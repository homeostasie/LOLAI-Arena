Bots must use stdin and stdout as communication channels. 
    In Python, that means outputing with print, inputing with raw_input()
    In C++, that means using cout and cin

Bots must use these channels without buffering<
    In python, you can do that by either flushing stdout after each print or starting the interpreter with the -u flag

Bots must print "OK" after initializing then wait for an input.

Bots must be in their own subdirectory in the directory Games/{game name}/bots/
Their directory must contain an executable file named 'start', launching the bot.

You can get the description of the protocole of each game in Games/{game name}/doc/bots .
