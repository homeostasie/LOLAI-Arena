Prisonnier
=========

Once the bot is initialised.

The game will send "A" which means that it is waiting for the choice:
    - "C\n" to cooperate
    - "T\n" to betray
Once bots have sent their choice, the game will send them the choice of the other bot.
Then it loops.

The game is finished when the game send "Q\n"
